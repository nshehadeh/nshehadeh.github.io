  <div class = "project-page_body">
    <p>This project was part of a class “Coding for a Cause” that I took my senior year of high school. Along with 5 of
      my friends who had also finished my high school’s CS curriculum, we spent a year building a sign-in and ordering
      system for a local food bank to keep track of their customers and help them better serve our community. This food bank
      was having trouble transitioning to handling their data online due to limited funds to hire a development team
      and outdated technology. </p>
    <img src = "img/caritas.png" alt = "Some more of the work" class = "about-me_img">
    <p>We built a website using NodeJS, PUG (HTML preprocessor), CSS, and used MongoDB to handle
      user information. Additionally, we learned about and implemented Scrum methodology. My main role on the
      project was front end design, but I also gained experience with backend and database work from one of my more
      experienced friends on the team. Having the website on an iPad in the food bank and seeing it working for the first
      time was extremely rewarding, and this was one of my favorite projects because of its real-world impact. </p>
