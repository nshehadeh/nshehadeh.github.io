    <p>Continuing my work in the BEAM lab at Vanderbilt's Institute for Surgery and Engineering, I am spending this
    semester on an individual, undergraduate research project where I will be <strong>increasing SNR of Ultrasound RF Data Using
        a Deep Neural Network </strong>. </p>
    <p><strong>Project Proposal: </strong> I propose to build a deep neural network to increase the quality of ultrasound RF data. Using
      a supervised learning approach, this neural network will be trained to improve image quality by increasing the
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data. Increasing SNR helps offset the image degradation caused by attenuation.
      Additionally, increasing SNR improves the separation of the blood flow signal and the noise floor, improving blood
      flow visualization. With application to blood flow imaging in mind, the goal would be to maintain high dynamic range
      performance along with the improvement in SNR to ensure that the blood flow signal is preserved. This neural network
      could be applied to any existing ultrasound RF data to improve its quality which would have a significant impact
      for projects within the BEAM Lab and for the field in general if successful. <strong> As part of this project, I will
      simulate or acquire training, testing, and validation data, design a neural network architecture, design a loss
        function, choose an optimizer, and perform a hyperparameter search </strong>. I will be using <strong>PyCharm </strong> for this project.</p>
    <p> As the first step in this project, I am enrolled in <strong>Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization series.</strong> I'm excited
    for this project to be my introduction into the world of deep learning, and hoping it ties well into my future classes
    in AI and deep learning related topics. I will be updating this page throughout the course of the project</p>
