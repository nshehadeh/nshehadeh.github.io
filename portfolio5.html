    <p>Continuing my work in the BEAM lab at Vanderbilt's Institute for Surgery and Engineering, I am spending this
    semester on an individual, undergraduate research project where I will be <strong>increasing SNR of Ultrasound RF Data Using
        a Deep Neural Network </strong>. </p>
    <p><strong>Project Proposal: </strong> I propose to build a deep neural network to increase the quality of ultrasound RF data. Using
      a supervised learning approach, this neural network will be trained to improve image quality by increasing the
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data. Increasing SNR helps offset the image degradation caused by attenuation.
      Additionally, increasing SNR improves the separation of the blood flow signal and the noise floor, improving blood
      flow visualization. With application to blood flow imaging in mind, the goal would be to maintain high dynamic range
      performance along with the improvement in SNR to ensure that the blood flow signal is preserved. This neural network
      could be applied to any existing ultrasound RF data to improve its quality which would have a significant impact
      for projects within the BEAM Lab and for the field in general if successful. <strong> As part of this project, I will
      simulate or acquire training, testing, and validation data, design a neural network architecture, design a loss
        function, choose an optimizer, and perform a hyperparameter search </strong>. I will be using <strong>PyTorch </strong> for this project.</p>
    <p> As the first step in this project, I completed the first two classes in <strong>Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization series.</strong> After
      completing the first two courses in the Coursera Specialization, I began going over the different aspects of my project.
      Given I am using simulated anechoic cyst data, I had to become familiar with the complicated routine of simulating new
      data on ACCRE. I also set up my Python environment to run the network on ACCRE, Vanderbilt's cluster system.
      Finally, I started building my architecture and getting a first iteration training. My neural network was feed
      forward and used a ReLU activation function, MSE loss function, and Adam optimizer for SGD. I properly separated
      the network into main, trainer, model, data loader, logger, and test model files. I specifically designed my code
      to be easily tuned in the future. Each hyper parameter is read in through a config file, making it extremely easy
      to try different layer widths, number of hidden layers, datasets, and more. When I continue this project to perform
      more in-depth hyper parameter tuning and test out different loss functions and models, it will be easy to alter my
      structure to fit future problems. For example, I sampled the 2D phantom data by the first dimension, the beams, but
      in the future the lab has found success using each phantom as an entire sample and using a convolutional neural network.
      Because my data loader is set up to be easily customizable, it would only take two lines of code to make these changes.
      I ran five different models toward the end of the semester and acquired some initial results. They were a proof of
      concept for my network, and I recorded loss curves and image quality metrics for modeled images to compare to the
      testing data input. The results show it is possible to increase SNR with a DNN, but it will take more tuning and
      experimentation to have a more consistent model to use on old clinical data.
